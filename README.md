You have so much to learn...

**What is WordPress?**

WordPress is a free, open-source web publishing system ( in other words: a free tool to help you build websites).It is used by governments, non-profits and fortune 500 companies. 17-20% of the web is powered by WordPress. It's very useful to use, especially for companies that change their content frequently (like a newspaper website) because you dont necessarily have to touch the code but can change the content through a dashboard that only the admins have access to.
